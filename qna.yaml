    The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of whether any ball or prototype complies with Appendix I or is otherwise approved, or not approved, for play. Such ruling may be taken on its own initiative or upon application by any party with a bona fide interest therein, including  any player, equipment manufacturer or National  Association  or  members  thereof.  Such  rulings  and  applications  shall  be made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Review  and  Hearing  Procedures  of  the International Tennis Federation (see Appendix XII).
    The event organisers must announce in advance of the event:
    - a. The number of balls for play (2, 3, 4 or 6).
    - b. The ball change policy, if any.
    Ball changes, if any, can be made either:
    - i. After an agreed odd number of games, in which case, the first ball change in the match shall take place two games earlier than for the rest of the match, to make allowance for the warm-up. A tie-break game counts as one game for the ball change. A ball change shall not take place at the beginning of a tie-break game: in this case, the ball change shall be delayed until the beginning of the second game of the next set; or
    - ii. At the beginning of a set
    If a ball gets broken during play, the point shall be replayed.
    If a ball is soft at the end of a point, should the point be replayed? Decision: If the ball is soft, not broken, the point shall not be replayed.
    Note: Any ball to be used in a tournament which is played under the Rules of Tennis must be named on the official ITF list of approved balls issued by the International Tennis Federation.

    ## 29. CONTINUOUS PLAY

    As a principle, play should be continuous, from the time the match starts (when the first service of the match is put in play) until the match finishes.

    - a. Between points, a maximum of twenty-five (25) seconds is allowed. When the players change ends at the end of a game, a maximum of ninety (90) seconds are allowed. However, after the first game of each set and during a tie-break game, play shall be continuous and the players shall change ends without a rest.
      - At the end of each set there shall be a set break of a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) seconds.
      - The maximum time starts from the moment that one point finishes until the first service is struck for the next point.
      - Event organisers may apply for ITF approval to extend the ninety (90) seconds allowed when the players change ends at the end of a game and the one hundred and twenty (120) seconds allowed at a set break.
    - b. If,  for  reasons  outside  the  player's  control,  clothing,  footwear  or  necessary equipment (excluding the racket) is broken or needs to be replaced, the player may be allowed reasonable extra time to rectify the problem.
    - c. No extra time shall be given to allow a player to recover condition. However, a player suffering from a treatable medical condition may be allowed one medical time-out of three minutes for the treatment of that medical condition. A limited number of toilet/change of attire breaks may also be allowed, if this is announced in advance of the event.
    - d. Event organisers may allow a rest period of a maximum of ten (10) minutes if this is announced in advance of the event. This rest period can be taken after the 3rd set in a best of 5 sets match, or after the 2nd set in a best of 3 sets match.
    - e. The  warm-up  time  shall  be  a  maximum  of  five  (5)  minutes,  unless  otherwise decided by the event organisers.
