Such ruling may be taken on its own initiative or upon application by any party with a bona fide interest therein, including  any player, equipment manufacturer or National  Association  or  members  thereof.  Such  rulings  and  applications  shall  be made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Review  and  Hearing  Procedures  of  the International Tennis Federation (see Appendix XII).

    Ball changes, if any, can be made either:
    - i. After an agreed odd number of games, in which case, the first ball change in the match shall take place two games earlier than for the rest of the match, to make allowance for the warm-up. A tie-break game counts as one game for the ball change.

    - ii. At the beginning of a set
    If a ball gets broken during play, the point shall be replayed.

    - b. If,  for  reasons  outside  the  player's  control,  clothing,  footwear  or  necessary equipment (excluding the racket) is broken or needs to be replaced, the player may be allowed reasonable extra time to rectify the problem.
    - c. No extra time shall be given to allow a player to recover condition. However, a player suffering from a treatable medical condition may be allowed one medical time-out of three minutes for the treatment of that medical condition. A limited number of toilet/change of attire breaks may also be allowed, if this is announced in advance of the event.
