## FOREWORD

The  International  Tennis  Federation  (ITF)  is  the  governing  body  of  the  game  of tennis and its duties and responsibilities include protecting the integrity of the game through determination of the Rules of Tennis.

To assist the ITF in carrying out this responsibility, the ITF has appointed a Rules of Tennis  Committee,  which  continually  monitors  the  game  and  its  rules  and,  when considered necessary, makes recommendations for changes to the Board of Directors of the ITF, who in turn make recommendations to the Annual General Meeting of the ITF, which is the ultimate authority for making any changes to the Rules of Tennis.

Appendix VI lists approved alternative procedures and scoring methods. In addition, on  its  own  behalf  or  on  application  by  interested  parties,  certain  variations  to  the rules  may  be  approved  by  the  ITF  for  trial  purposes  only  at  a  limited  number  of tournaments  or  events  and/or  for  a  limited  time  period.  Such  variations  are  not included in the published rules and require a report to the ITF on the conclusion of the approved trial.

## 1. THE COURT

The  court  shall  be  a  rectangle,  78 feet  (23.77 m)  long  and,  for  singles  matches, 27 feet  (8.23 m)  wide.  For  doubles  matches,  the  court  shall  be  36 feet  (10.97 m) wide.

The court shall be divided across the middle by a net suspended by a cord or metal cable which shall pass over or be attached to two net posts at a height of 3 ½ feet (1.07 m). The net shall be fully extended so that it completely fills the space between the  two  net  posts,  and  it  must  be  of  sufficiently  small  mesh  to  ensure  that  a  ball cannot pass through it. The height of the net shall be 3 feet (0.914 m) at the centre, where it shall be held down tightly by a strap. A band shall cover the cord or metal cable and the top of the net. The strap and band shall be completely white.

- · The maximum diameter of the cord or metal cable shall be 1/3 inch (0.8 cm).
- · The maximum width of the strap shall be 2 inches (5 cm).
- · The  band  shall  be  between  2 inches  (5 cm)  and  2½ inches  (6.35 cm)  deep  on each side.

For doubles matches, the centres of the net posts shall be 3 feet (0.914 m) outside the doubles court on each side.

For singles matches, if a singles net is used, the centres of the net posts shall be 3 feet (0.914 m) outside the singles court on each side. If a doubles net is used, then the net shall be supported, at a height of 3½ feet (1.07 m), by two singles sticks, the centres of which shall be 3 feet (0.914 m) outside the singles court on each side.

- · The net posts shall not be more than 6 inches (15 cm) square or 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.
- · The singles  sticks  shall  not  be  more  than  3 inches  (7.5 cm)  square  or  3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter.
- · The net posts and singles sticks shall not be more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the top of the net cord.

The lines at the ends of the court are called baselines and the lines at the sides of the court are called sidelines.

Two lines shall be drawn between the singles sidelines, 21 feet (6.40 m) from each side of the net, parallel with the net. These lines are called the servicelines. On each side of the net, the area between the serviceline and the net shall be divided into two equal parts, the service courts, by the centre serviceline. The centre serviceline shall be drawn parallel with the singles sidelines and half-way between them.

Each baseline shall be divided in half by a centre mark, 4 inches (10 cm) in length, which shall be drawn inside the court and parallel with the singles sidelines.

- · The centre serviceline and centre mark shall be 2 inches (5 cm) wide.

- · The other lines of the court shall be between 1 inch (2.5 cm) and 2 inches (5 cm) wide, except that the baselines may be up to 4 inches (10 cm) wide.

All court measurements shall be made to the outside of the lines and all lines of the court shall be of the same colour clearly contrasting with the colour of the surface.

No advertising is allowed on the court, net, strap, band, net posts or singles sticks except as provided in Appendix V.

In addition to the court described above, the court designated as 'Red' and the court designated  as  'Orange'  in  Appendix  VIII  can  be  used  for  10  and  under  tennis competition.

Note: Guidelines  for  minimum  distances  between  the  baseline  and  backstops  and between the sidelines and sidestops can be found in Appendix X.

## 2. PERMANENT FIXTURES

The  permanent  fixtures  of  the  court  include  the  backstops  and  sidestops,  the spectators, the stands and seats for spectators, all other fixtures around and above the court,  the  chair  umpire,  line  umpires,  net  umpire  and  ball  persons  when  in  their recognised positions.

In a singles match played with a doubles net and singles sticks, the net posts and the part  of  the  net  outside  the  singles  sticks  are  permanent  fixtures  and  are  not considered as net posts or part of the net.

## Case 1: Can objects be attached to the net post?

Decision: Yes, provided that these objects are reasonable in size and placement and approved  as  Player  Analysis  Technology.  As  a  guide,  attachments  should  not  be more than 50 cm wide (parallel to the net),  40 cm deep (perpendicular to the net) and 122 cm in height. Attachments should be placed so that they do not extend more than 10 cm inside the net post and not extend more than 20 cm above the net post or extend more than 20 cm from the plane of the net.

## 3. THE BALL

Balls, which are approved for play under the Rules of Tennis, must comply with the specifications in Appendix I.

The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of whether any ball or prototype complies with Appendix I or is otherwise approved, or not approved, for play. Such ruling may be taken on its own initiative or upon application by any party with a bona fide interest therein, including  any player, equipment manufacturer or National  Association  or  members  thereof.  Such  rulings  and  applications  shall  be made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Review  and  Hearing  Procedures  of  the International Tennis Federation (see Appendix XII).

The event organisers must announce in advance of the event:

- a. The number of balls for play (2, 3, 4 or 6).
- b. The ball change policy, if any.

Ball changes, if any, can be made either:

- i. After an agreed odd number of games, in which case, the first ball change in the match shall take place two games earlier than for the rest of the match, to make allowance for the warm-up. A tie-break game counts as one game for the ball change. A ball change shall not take place at the beginning of a tie-break game: in this case, the ball change shall be delayed until the beginning of the second game of the next set; or
- ii. At the beginning of a set

If a ball gets broken during play, the point shall be replayed.

Case 1: If a ball is soft at the end of a point, should the point be replayed? Decision: If the ball is soft, not broken, the point shall not be replayed.

Note: Any ball to be used in a tournament which is played under the Rules of Tennis must be named on the official ITF list of approved balls issued by the International Tennis Federation.

## 4. THE RACKET

Rackets, which are approved for play under the Rules of Tennis, must comply with the specifications in Appendix II.

The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of whether any racket or prototype complies with Appendix II or is otherwise approved, or not approved, for play. Such ruling may be undertaken on its own initiative or upon application by any  party  with  a  bona  fide  interest  therein,  including  any  player,  equipment manufacturer  or National Association or members  thereof.  Such  rulings and applications  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  applicable  Review  and  Hearing Procedures of the International Tennis Federation (see Appendix XII).

Case 1: Is more than one set of strings allowed on the hitting surface of a racket? Decision:  No.  The  rule  mentions  a  pattern  (not  patterns)  of  crossed  strings.  (See Appendix II)

Case 2: Is the stringing pattern of a racket considered to be generally uniform and flat if the strings are on more than one plane?

Decision: No.

Case 3: Can vibration damping devices be placed on the strings of a racket? If so, where can they be placed?

Decision:  Yes,  but  these  devices  may  only  be  placed  outside  the  pattern  of  the crossed strings.

Case  4:  During  a  point,  a  player  accidentally  breaks  the  strings.  Can  the  player continue to play another point with this racket? Decision: Yes, except where specifically prohibited by event organisers.

Case 5: Is a player allowed to use more than one racket at any time during play? Decision: No.

Case  6:  Can  a  battery  that  affects  playing  characteristics  be  incorporated  into  a racket? Decision: No. A battery is prohibited because it is an energy source, as are solar cells and other similar devices.

## 5. SCORE IN A GAME

## a. Standard game

A standard game is scored as follows with the server's score being called first:

No point

-

'Love' '15'

First point

-

Second point

- '30'

Third point

- '40'

Fourth point

- 'Game'

except  that  if  each  player/team  has  won  three  points,  the  score  is  'Deuce'. After  'Deuce',  the  score  is  'Advantage'  for  the  player/team  who  wins  the next point. If that same player/team also wins the next point, that player/team wins the 'Game'; if the opposing player/team wins the next point, the score is again 'Deuce'. A player/team needs to win two consecutive points immediately after 'Deuce' to win the 'Game'.

## b. Tie-break game

During a tie-break game, points are scored 'Zero', '1', '2', '3', etc. The first player/team to win seven points wins the 'Game' and 'Set', provided there is a margin of two points over the opponent(s). If necessary, the tie-break game shall continue until this margin is achieved.

The player whose turn it is to serve shall serve the first point of the tie-break game.  The  following  two  points  shall  be  served  by  the  opponent(s)  (in doubles, the player of the opposing team due to serve next). After this, each player/team shall serve alternately for two consecutive points until the end of the tie-break game (in doubles, the rotation of service within each team shall continue in the same order as during that set).

The player/team whose turn it was to serve first in the tie-break game shall be the receiver in the first game of the following set.

Additional approved alternative scoring methods can be found in Appendix VI.

## 6. SCORE IN A SET

There  are  different  methods  of  scoring  in  a  set.  The  two  main  methods  are  the 'Advantage Set' and the 'Tie-break Set'. Either method may be used provided that the  one  to  be  used  is  announced  in  advance  of  the  event   If  the  'Tie-break  Set' . method is to be used, it must also be announced whether the final set will be played as a 'Tie-break Set' or an 'Advantage Set'.

## a. 'Advantage Set'

The  first  player/team  to  win  six  games  wins  that  'Set',  provided  there  is  a margin of two games over the opponent(s). If necessary, the set shall continue until this margin is achieved.

- b. 'Tie-break Set' The  first  player/team  to  win  six  games  wins  that  'Set',  provided  there  is  a margin of two games over the opponent(s). If the score reaches six games all, a

tie-break game shall be played.

Additional approved alternative scoring methods can be found in Appendix VI.

## 7. SCORE IN A MATCH

A match can be played to the best of 3 sets (a player/team needs to win 2 sets to win the  match)  or  to  the  best  of  5  sets  (a  player/team  needs  to  win  3  sets  to  win  the match).

Additional approved alternative scoring methods can be found in Appendix VI.

## 8. SERVER AND RECEIVER

The players/teams shall stand on opposite sides of the net. The server is the player who puts the ball into play for the first point. The receiver is the player who is ready to return the ball served by the server.

Case 1: Is the receiver allowed to stand outside the lines of the court?

Decision: Yes. The receiver may take any position inside or outside the lines on the receiver's side of the net.

## 9. CHOICE OF ENDS AND SERVICE

The choice of ends and the choice to be server or receiver in the first game shall be decided by toss before the warm-up starts. The player/team who wins the toss may choose:

- a. To  be  server  or  receiver  in  the  first  game  of  the  match,  in  which  case  the opponent(s) shall choose the end of the court for the first game of the match; or
- b. The  end  of  the  court  for  the  first  game  of  the  match,  in  which  case  the opponent(s) shall choose to be server or receiver for the first game of the match; or
- c. To require the opponent(s) to make one of the above choices.

Case  1:  Do  both  players/teams  have  the  right  to  new  choices  if  the  warm-up  is stopped and the players leave the court? Decision: Yes. The result of the original toss stands, but new choices may be made by both players/teams.

## 10. CHANGE OF ENDS

The players shall change ends at the end of the first, third and every subsequent odd game of each set. The players shall also change ends at the end of each set unless the total number of games in that set is even, in which case the players change ends at the end of the first game of the next set.

During a tie-break game, players shall change ends after every six points.

Additional approved alternative procedures can be found in Appendix VI.

## 11. BALL IN PLAY

Unless a fault or a let is called, the ball is in play from the moment the server hits the ball, and remains in play until the point is decided.

## 12. BALL TOUCHES A LINE

If a ball touches a line, it is regarded as touching the court bounded by that line.

## 13. BALL TOUCHES A PERMANENT FIXTURE

If  the ball in play touches a permanent fixture after it has hit the correct court, the player who hit the ball wins the point. If the ball in play touches a permanent fixture before it hits the ground, the player who hit the ball loses the point.

## 14. ORDER OF SERVICE

At the end of each standard game, the receiver shall become the server and the server shall become the receiver for the next game.

In  doubles,  the  team  due  to  serve  in  the  first  game  of  each  set  shall  decide  which player  shall  serve  for  that  game.  Similarly,  before  the  second  game  starts,  their opponents  shall  decide  which  player  shall  serve  for  that  game.  The  partner  of  the player who served in the first game shall serve in the third game and the partner of the  player  who  served  in  the  second  game  shall  serve  in  the  fourth  game.  This rotation shall continue until the end of the set.

## 15. ORDER OF RECEIVING IN DOUBLES

The team which is due to receive in the first game of a set shall decide which player shall  receive  the  first  point  in  the  game.  Similarly,  before  the  second  game  starts, their opponents shall decide which player shall receive the first point of that game. The player who was the receiver's partner for the first point of the game shall receive the second point and this rotation shall continue until the end of the game and the set. After the receiver has returned the ball, either player in a team can hit the ball.

Case  1:  Is  one  member  of  a  doubles  team  allowed  to  play  alone  against  the opponents?

Decision: No.

## 16. THE SERVICE

Immediately  before  starting  the  service  motion,  the  server  shall  stand  at  rest  with both feet behind (i.e. further from the net than) the baseline and within the imaginary extensions of the centre mark and the sideline.

The server shall then release the ball by hand in any direction and hit the ball with the  racket  before  the  ball  hits  the  ground.  The  service  motion  is  completed  at  the moment that the player's racket hits or misses the ball. A player who is able to use only one arm may use the racket for the release of the ball.

## 17. SERVING

When serving in a standard game, the server shall stand behind alternate halves of the court, starting from the right half of the court in every game.

In a tie-break game, the service shall be served from behind alternate halves of the court, with the first served from the right half of the court.

The  service  shall  pass  over  the  net  and  hit  the  service  court  diagonally  opposite before the receiver returns it.

## 18. FOOT FAULT

During the service motion, the server shall not:

- a. Change position by walking or running, although slight movements of the feet are permitted; or
- b. Touch the baseline or the court with either foot; or
- c. Touch the area outside the imaginary extension of the sideline with either foot; or
- d. Touch the imaginary extension of the centre mark with either foot.

If the server breaks this rule it is a 'Foot Fault'.

Case 1: In a singles match, is the server allowed to serve standing behind the part of the baseline between the singles sideline and the doubles sideline? Decision: No.

Case 2: Is the server allowed to have one or both feet off the ground? Decision: Yes.

## 19. SERVICE FAULT

The service is a fault if:

- a. The server breaks Rules 16, 17 or 18; or

- b. The server misses the ball when trying to hit it; or
- c. The ball served touches a permanent fixture, singles stick or net post before it hits the ground; or
- d. The ball served touches the server or server's partner, or anything the server or server's partner is wearing or carrying.

Case 1: After tossing a ball to serve, the server decides not to hit it and catches it instead. Is this a fault?

Decision: No. A player, who tosses the ball and then decides not to hit it, is allowed to catch the ball with the hand or the racket, or to let the ball bounce.

Case 2: During a singles match played on a court with net posts and singles sticks, the ball served hits a singles stick and then hits the correct service court. Is this a fault?

Decision: Yes.

## 20. SECOND SERVICE

If the first service is a fault, the server shall serve again without delay from behind the same half of the court from which that fault was served, unless the service was from the wrong half.

## 21. WHEN TO SERVE AND RECEIVE

The server shall not serve until the receiver is ready. However, the receiver shall play to the reasonable pace of the server and shall be ready to receive within a reasonable time of the server being ready.

A receiver who attempts to return the service shall be considered as being ready. If it is demonstrated that the receiver is not ready, the service cannot be called a fault.

## 22. THE LET DURING A SERVICE

The service is a let if:

- a. The ball served touches the net, strap or band, and is otherwise good; or, after touching the net, strap or band, touches the receiver or the receiver's partner or anything they wear or carry before hitting the ground; or
- b. The ball is served when the receiver is not ready.

In the case of a service let, that particular service shall not count, and the server shall serve again, but a service let does not cancel a previous fault.

Additional approved alternative procedures can be found in Appendix VI.

## 23. THE LET

In  all  cases  when  a  let  is  called,  except  when  a  service  let  is  called  on  a  second service, the whole point shall be replayed.

Case 1: When the ball is in play, another ball rolls onto court. A let is called. The server had previously served a fault. Is the server now entitled to a first service or second service?

Decision: First service. The whole point must be replayed.

## 24. PLAYER LOSES POINT

The point is lost if:

- a. The player serves two consecutive faults; or
- b. The player does not return the ball in play before it bounces twice consecutively; or
- c. The player returns the ball in play so that it hits the ground or, before it bounces, an object outside the correct court; or
- d. The player returns the ball in play so that, before it bounces, it hits a permanent fixture; or
- e. The receiver returns the service before it bounces; or
- f. The  player  deliberately  carries  or  catches  the  ball  in  play  on  the  racket  or deliberately touches it with the racket more than once; or
- g. The player or the racket, whether in the player's hand or not, or anything which the player is wearing or carrying touches the net, net posts/singles sticks, cord or metal cable, strap or band, or the opponent's court at any time while the ball is in play; or
- h. The player hits the ball before it has passed the net; or
- i. The  ball  in  play  touches  the  player  or  anything  that  the  player  is  wearing  or carrying, except the racket; or
- j. The ball in play touches the racket when the player is not holding it; or
- k. The player deliberately and materially changes the shape of the racket when the ball is in play; or
- l. In doubles, both players touch the ball when returning it.

Case 1: After the server has served a first service, the racket falls out of the server's hand and touches the net before the ball has bounced. Is this a service fault, or does the server lose the point?

Decision: The server loses the point because the racket touches the net while the ball is in play.

Case 2: After the server has served a first service, the racket falls out of the server's hand and touches the net after the ball has bounced outside the correct service court. Is this a service fault, or does the server lose the point?

Decision: This is a service fault because when the racket touched the net the ball was no longer in play.

Case 3: In a doubles match, the receiver's partner touches the net before the ball that has been served touches the ground outside the correct service court. What is the correct decision?

Decision: The receiving team loses the point because the receiver's partner touched the net while the ball was in play.

Case 4: Does a player lose the point if an imaginary line in the extension of the net is crossed before or after hitting the ball?

Decision: The player does not lose the point in either case provided the player does not touch the opponent's court.

Case 5: Is a player allowed to jump over the net into the opponent's court while the ball is in play?

Decision: No. The player loses the point.

Case 6: A player throws the racket at the ball in play. Both the racket and the ball land in the court on the opponent's side of the net and the opponent(s) is unable to reach the ball. Which player wins the point?

Decision: The player who threw the racket at the ball loses the point.

Case  7:  A  ball  that  has  just  been  served  hits  the  receiver  or,  in  doubles,  the receiver's partner before it touches the ground. Which player wins the point? Decision: The server wins the point, unless it is a service let.

Case  8:  A  player  standing  outside  the  court  hits  the  ball  or  catches  it  before  it bounces and claims the point because the ball was definitely going out of the correct court.

Decision: The player loses the point, unless it is a good return, in which case the point continues.

## 25. A GOOD RETURN

It is a good return if:

- a. The ball touches the net, net  posts/singles sticks,  cord  or  metal  cable,  strap  or band,  provided  that  it  passes  over  any  of  them  and  hits  the  ground  within  the correct court; except as provided in Rule 2 and 24 (d); or
- b. After the ball in play has hit the ground within the correct court and has spun or been blown back over the net, the player reaches over the net and plays the ball into the correct court, provided that the player does not break Rule 24; or
- c. The ball is returned outside the net posts, either above or below the level of the top  of  the  net,  even  though  it  touches  the  net  posts   provided  that  it  hits  the , ground in the correct court; except as provided in Rules 2 and 24 (d); or
- d. The ball passes under the net cord between the singles stick and the adjacent net post without touching either net, net cord or net post and hits the ground in the correct court, or
- e. The player's racket passes over the net after hitting the ball on the player's own side of the net and the ball hits the ground in the correct court; or
- f. The player hits the ball in play, which hits another ball lying in the correct court.

Case 1: A player returns a ball which then hits a singles stick and hits the ground in the correct court. Is this a good return?

Decision: Yes. However, if the ball is served and hits the singles stick, it is a service fault.

Case 2: A ball in play hits another ball which is lying in the correct court. What is the correct decision?

Decision: Play continues. However, if it is not clear that the actual ball in play has been returned, a let should be called.

## 26. HINDRANCE

If a player is hindered in playing the point by a deliberate act of the opponent(s), the player shall win the point.

However, the point shall be replayed if a player is hindered in playing the point by either an unintentional act of the opponent(s), or something outside the player's own control (not including a permanent fixture).

Case 1: Is an unintentional double hit a hindrance? Decision: No. See also Rule 24 (f).

Case 2: A player claims to have stopped play because the player thought that the opponent(s) was being hindered. Is this a hindrance? Decision: No, the player loses the point.

Case 3: A ball in play hits a bird flying over the court. Is this a hindrance?

Decision: Yes, the point shall be replayed.

Case 4: During a point, a ball or other object that was lying on the player's side of the net when the point started hinders the player. Is this a hindrance? Decision: No.

Case 5: In doubles, where are the server's partner and receiver's partner allowed to stand?

Decision: The server's partner and the receiver's partner may take any position on their own side of the net, inside or outside the court. However, if a player is creating a hindrance to the opponent(s), the hindrance rule should be used.

## 27. CORRECTING ERRORS

As  a  principle,  when  an  error  in  respect  of  the  Rules  of  Tennis  is  discovered,  all points  previously  played  shall  stand.  Errors  so  discovered  shall  be  corrected  as follows:

- a. During a standard game or a tie-break game, if a player serves from the wrong half of the court, this should be corrected as soon as the error is discovered, and the server shall serve from the correct half of the court according to the score. A fault that was served before the error was discovered shall stand.
- b. During a standard game or a tie-break game, if the players are at the wrong ends of  the  court,  the  error  should  be  corrected  as  soon  as  it  is  discovered,  and  the server shall serve from the correct end of the court according to the score.
- c. If  a  player  serves  out  of  turn  during  a  standard  game,  the  player  who  was originally due to serve shall serve as soon as the error is discovered. However, if

- a  game  is  completed  before  the  error  is  discovered  the  order  of  service  shall remain  as  altered.  In  this  case,  any  ball  change  to  be  made  after  an  agreed number of games should be made one game later than originally scheduled.
- A fault that was served by the opponents(s) before the error was discovered shall not stand.
- In doubles, if the partners of one team serve out of turn, a fault that was served before the error was discovered shall stand.
- d. If a player serves out of turn during a tie-break game and the error is discovered after an  even  number  of  points  have  been  played,  the  error  is  corrected immediately. If the error is discovered after an odd number of points have been played, the order of service shall remain as altered.
- A fault that was served by the opponent(s) before the error was discovered shall not stand.
- In doubles, if the partners of one team serve out of turn, a fault that was served before the error was discovered shall stand.
- e. During a standard game or a tie-break game in doubles, if there is an error in the order of receiving, this shall remain as altered until the end of the game in which the error is discovered. For the next game in which they are the receivers in that set, the partners shall then resume the original order of receiving.
- f. If  in  error  a  tie-break  game  is  started  at  6  games  all,  when  it  was  previously agreed  that  the  set  would  be  an  'Advantage  set',  the  error  shall  be  corrected immediately if only one point has been played. If the error is discovered after the second point is in play, the set will continue as a 'Tie-break set'.
- g. If  in  error  a  standard  game  is  started  at  6  games  all,  when  it  was  previously agreed  that  the  set  would  be  a  'Tie-break  set',  the  error  shall  be  corrected immediately if only one point has been played. If the error is discovered after the second  point  is  in  play,  the  set  will  continue  as  an  'Advantage  set'  until  the score reaches 8 games all (or a higher even number), when a tie-break game shall be played.
- h. If in  error  an  'Advantage  set'  or  'Tie-break  set'  is  started,  when  it  was previously agreed that the final set would be a match tie-break, the error shall be corrected  immediately  if  only  one  point  has  been  played.  If  the  error  is discovered after the second point is in play, the set will continue either until a player or team wins three games (and therefore the set) or until the score reaches 2  games  all,  when  a  match  tie-break  shall  be  played.  However,  if  the  error  is discovered  after  the  second  point  of  the  fifth  game  has  started,  the  set  will continue as a 'Tie-break set'. (See Appendix VI)
- i. If the balls are not changed in the correct sequence, the error shall be corrected when the player/team who should have served with new balls is next due to serve a new game. Thereafter the balls shall be changed so that the number of games between ball changes shall be that originally agreed. Balls should not be changed during a game.

## 28. ROLE OF COURT OFFICIALS

For  matches  where  officials  are  appointed,  their  roles  and  responsibilities  can  be found in Appendix VII.

## 29. CONTINUOUS PLAY

As a principle, play should be continuous, from the time the match starts (when the first service of the match is put in play) until the match finishes.

- a. Between points, a maximum of twenty-five (25) seconds is allowed. When the players change ends at the end of a game, a maximum of ninety (90) seconds are allowed. However, after the first game of each set and during a tie-break game, play shall be continuous and the players shall change ends without a rest.
- At the end of each set there shall be a set break of a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) seconds.
- The maximum time starts from the moment that one point finishes until the first service is struck for the next point.
- Event organisers may apply for ITF approval to extend the ninety (90) seconds allowed when the players change ends at the end of a game and the one hundred and twenty (120) seconds allowed at a set break.
- b. If,  for  reasons  outside  the  player's  control,  clothing,  footwear  or  necessary equipment (excluding the racket) is broken or needs to be replaced, the player may be allowed reasonable extra time to rectify the problem.
- c. No extra time shall be given to allow a player to recover condition. However, a player suffering from a treatable medical condition may be allowed one medical time-out of three minutes for the treatment of that medical condition. A limited number of toilet/change of attire breaks may also be allowed, if this is announced in advance of the event.
- d. Event organisers may allow a rest period of a maximum of ten (10) minutes if this is announced in advance of the event. This rest period can be taken after the 3rd set in a best of 5 sets match, or after the 2nd set in a best of 3 sets match.
- e. The  warm-up  time  shall  be  a  maximum  of  five  (5)  minutes,  unless  otherwise decided by the event organisers.

## 30. COACHING

'Coaching'  is  advice  or  instruction  of  any  kind  and  by  any  means  to  a  player. Coaching  from  an  off-court  location  ('Off-Court  Coaching')  may  be  permitted  in events played under the Rules of Tennis by the sanctioning body concerned.

In team events only, where there is a team captain sitting on-court, the team captain may give Coaching to the player(s)  at  such  times  as  permitted  by  the  sanctioning body  concerned ('On-Court  Coaching'). In all other competitions, On-Court Coaching is not permitted.

If permitted by the sanctioning body, players may access approved Player Analysis Technology at times when Coaching is permitted.

Coaching is subject to the conditions set out in Appendix IV.

Coaching is not permitted during the playing of a point.

## 31. PLAYER ANALYSIS TECHNOLOGY

Player  Analysis  Technology,  that  is  approved  for  play  under  the  Rules  of  Tennis, must comply with the specifications in Appendix III.

The International Tennis Federation shall rule on the question of whether any such equipment  is  approved,  or  not  approved.  Such  ruling  may  be  taken  on  its  own initiative,  or  upon  application  by  any  party  with  a  bona  fide  interest  therein, including any player, equipment manufacturer or National Association or members thereof.  Such  rulings  and  applications  shall  be  made  in  accordance  with  the applicable  Review  and  Hearing  Procedures  of  the  International  Tennis  Federation (see Appendix XII).

## RULES OF WHEELCHAIR TENNIS

The game of wheelchair tennis follows the ITF Rules of Tennis with the following exceptions:

## a. The Two Bounce Rule

The wheelchair tennis player is allowed two bounces of the ball. The player must return the ball before it bounces a third time. The second bounce can be either in or out of the court boundaries.

## b. The Wheelchair

- iii. If conventional methods for the service are physically impossible for a quad player, then the player or another individual may drop the ball for such a player and allow it to bounce before it is struck. If this is the case, the same method of serving must be used for the entire match.

## d. Player Loses Point

A player loses a point if:

- i. The player fails to return the ball before it has bounced three times; or
- ii. Subject to rule f) below the player uses any part of their feet or lower extremities  against  the  ground  or  against  any  wheel  while  delivering service, striking a ball, turning or stopping while the ball is in play; or
- iii. The player fails to keep one buttock  in contact with  their wheelchair seat when contacting the ball.

## e. The Wheelchair

Wheelchairs  used  in  all  competitions  played  under  the  Rules  of  Wheelchair Tennis must comply with the following specifications:

- ii. Wheels may have a single pushrim only. No changes to the wheelchair that  afford  the  player  a  mechanical  advantage  are  permitted,  such  as levers or gears. During normal play, wheels shall not leave permanent marks on, or otherwise damage, the court surface.

- iii. Subject  to  Rule  e(v),  players  shall  use  only  the  wheels  (including pushrims) to propel the wheelchair. No steering, braking or gearing or other  device  that  may  assist  operation  of  the  wheelchair,  including energy storage systems, is permitted.
- iv. The height of the seat (including cushion) shall be fixed and players' buttocks shall remain in contact with the seat during the playing of a point. Strapping may be used to secure the player to the wheelchair.
- v. Players who meet the requirements of Article 10 of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Classification Rules may use a wheelchair powered by electric motor(s) (a 'powered wheelchair'). Powered wheelchairs must not be able to exceed 15 km/h in any direction and shall be controlled by the player only.
- vi. Applications  may  be  made  for  modifications  to  the  wheelchair  for legitimate medical reasons. All such applications shall be submitted to the ITF  Sport  Science  &amp;  Medicine  Commission  for  approval  a minimum of 60 days prior to intended use in an ITF-sanctioned event. A decision  to  reject  a  proposed  modification  may  be  appealed  under Chapter III of the ITF Wheelchair Tennis Regulations.

## f. Propelling the Chair with the Foot

- i. If due to lack of capacity a player is unable to propel the wheelchair via the wheel, then they may propel the wheelchair using one foot.
- ii. Even  if  in  accordance  with  rule  f)  i.  above  a  player  is  permitted  to propel the chair using one foot, no part of the player's foot may be in contact with the ground:

## Notes:

1 The deformation shall be the average of a single reading along each of three perpendicular axes. There is no limit on the difference between individual forward deformation readings. There is no specification for return deformation.

2 All coloured dots shall be reasonable in size and placement.

- e. All tests for rebound, mass, size, deformation and durability shall be made in accordance  with  the  Regulations  described  in  the  current  edition  of ITF Approved Tennis Balls, Classified Surfaces &amp; Recognised Courts .

## CLASSIFICATION OF COURT PACE

The ITF test method used for determining the pace of a court surface is ITF CS 01/02 (ITF Court Pace Rating) as described in the ITF publication entitled 'ITF guide to test methods for tennis court surfaces'.

Court surfaces which have an ITF Court Pace Rating of 0 to 29 shall be classified as being Category 1 (slow pace). Examples of court surface types which conform to this classification  will  include  most  clay  courts  and  other  types  of  unbound  mineral surface.

Court surfaces which have an ITF Court Pace Rating of 30 to 34 shall be classified as being Category 2 (medium-slow pace), while court surfaces with an ITF Court Pace Rating of 35 to 39 shall be classified as being Category 3 (medium pace). Examples of court surface types which conform to this classification will include most acrylic coated surfaces plus some carpet surfaces.

Court surfaces with an ITF Court Pace Rating of 40 to 44 shall be classified as being Category 4 (medium-fast pace), while court surfaces which have an ITF Court Pace Rating of 45 or more shall be classified as being Category 5 (fast pace). Examples of court  surface  types  which  conform  to  this  classification  will  include  most  natural grass, artificial grass and some carpet surfaces.

Case 1: Which ball type should be used on which court surface?

Decision: 3 different types of balls are approved for play under the Rules of Tennis, however:

- a. Ball Type 1 (fast speed) is intended for play on slow pace court surfaces
- b. Ball Type 2 (medium speed) is intended for play on medium-slow, medium and medium-fast pace court surfaces
- c. Ball Type 3 (slow speed) is intended for play on fast pace court surfaces

Note: In addition to the ball types specified under paragraph (b) above, the Stage 1 (Green) ball may be used for all levels of competitive play except for world ranking professional  tennis  events,  Davis  Cup  and  Billie  Jean  King  Cup,  the  Olympic  and Paralympic Tennis Events, World  Tennis Tour Men's, Women's  and  Junior Tournaments  and  Team  events  sanctioned  by  the  ITF  and  affiliated  Regional Associations, ITF World Tennis Masters Tour and Team events and ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour and Team events.

Each National Association shall have the right to decide which national competitive events should use the Stage 1 (Green) ball.

## APPENDIX II

## THE RACKET

For all measurements in Appendix II, SI units shall take precedence.

- a. The racket shall  consist  of  a  frame  and  string(s).  The  frame  shall  consist  of  a handle and head, and may also include a throat. The head is defined as that part of the racket to which the string(s) connect. The handle is defined as that part of the racket connected to the head which is held by the player in normal use. The throat, where present, is that part of the racket that joins the handle to the head.
- b. The hitting surface, defined as the main area of the stringing pattern bordered by the points of entry of the strings into the head or points of contact of the strings with the head, whichever is the smaller, shall be flat and consist of a pattern of crossed strings, which shall be alternately interlaced or bonded where they cross. The stringing pattern must be generally uniform and, in particular, not less dense in the centre than in any other area.

## APPENDIX VI

## ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES AND SCORING METHODS

The alternatives listed in this Appendix VI may be used.

## SCORE IN A GAME (Rule 5):

'NO-AD' SCORING METHOD

A 'No-Ad' game is scored as follows with the server's score being called first:

No points

- 'Love'

First point

- '15'

Second point

-

'30'

Third point

- '40'

Fourth point

-

'Game'

If each player/team has won three points, the score is 'Deuce' and a deciding point shall be played. The receiver(s) shall choose whether to receive the service from the right half or the left half of the court. In doubles, the players of the receiving team cannot change positions to receive this deciding point. The player/team who wins the deciding point wins the 'Game'.

In  mixed  doubles,  the  player  of  the  same  gender  as  the  server  shall  receive  the deciding point. The players of the receiving team cannot change positions to receive the deciding point.

## SCORE IN A SET (Rules 6 and 7):

## 1. SHORT SETS

The first player/team to win four games wins the set, provided there is a margin of  two  games  over  the  opponent(s).  If  the  score  reaches  four  games  all,  a  tiebreak  game shall  be  played.  Alternatively  (at  the  discretion  of  the  sanctioning body), if the score reaches three games all, a tie-break game shall be played.

## 2. SHORT SET TIE-BREAK (5 POINTS)

When  playing  Short  Sets  only,  a  Short  Set  tie-break  may  be  used.  The  first player/team to win five points wins the 'Game' and 'Set', with a deciding point if the score reaches four all. The order and number of serves shall be determined by the sanctioning body. Players/Teams will only change ends after the first four points have been played.

## 3. MATCH TIE-BREAK (7 POINTS)

When  the  score  in  a  match  is  one  set  all,  or  two  sets  all  in  best  of  five  sets matches, one tie-break game may be played to decide the match. This tie-break game replaces the deciding final set.

The first player/team to win seven points shall win the match tie-break and the match  provided  there  is  a  margin  of  two  points  over  the  opponent(s).  If necessary, the match tie-break game shall continue until this margin is achieved.

## 4. MATCH TIE-BREAK (10 POINTS)

When  the  score  in  a  match  is  one  set  all,  or  two  sets  all  in  best  of  five  sets matches, one tie-break game may be played to decide the match. This tie-break game replaces the deciding final set.

The  first  player/team  to  win  ten  points  shall  win  the  match  tie-break  and  the match  provided  there  is  a  margin  of  two  points  over  the  opponent(s).  If necessary, the match tie-break game shall continue until this margin is achieved.

Note : When using the match tie-break to replace the final set:

- · the original order of service continues. (Rules 5 and 14)
- · in doubles, the order of serving and receiving within the team may be altered, as in the beginning of each set. (Rules 14 and 15)
- · before the start of the match tie-break there shall be a 120-second set break.
- · balls should not be changed before the start of the match tie-break even if a ball change is due.

## 5. FINAL SET TIE-BREAK (10 POINTS)

When the score in a match is one set all, or two sets all  in  a best of five sets match,  and  six  games  all  in  the  final  set,  a  ten-point  tie-break  game  may  be played to decide the match. The first player/team to win ten points shall win the tie-break  and  the  match  provided  there  is  a  margin  of  two  points  over  the opponent(s). If necessary, the tie-break game shall continue until this margin is achieved.

## CHANGE OF ENDS (Rule 10):

During a tie-break game, players shall change ends after the first point and thereafter after every four points.

## THE LET DURING A SERVICE (Rule 22):

'NO LET' RULE

This  alternative  is  play  without  the  service  let  in  Rule  22.a,  whereby  a  serve  that touches the net, strap or band is in play. At the discretion of the sanctioning body, when playing doubles using Short Sets in combination with No-Ad scoring and the No-Let rule, either player on the receiving team is permitted to return  a serve that touches the net, strap or band and lands within the correct service box.

## APPENDIX VII

## ROLE OF COURT OFFICIALS

The  referee  is  the  final  authority  on  all  questions  of  tennis  law  and  the  referee's decision is final.

In matches where a chair umpire is assigned, the chair umpire is the final authority on all questions of fact during the match.

The players have the right to call the referee to court if they disagree with a chair umpire's interpretation of tennis law.

In  matches  where  line  umpires  and  net  umpires  are  assigned,  they  make  all  calls (including foot-fault calls) relating to that line or net. The chair umpire has the right to  overrule  a  line  umpire  or  a  net  umpire  if  the  chair  umpire  is  sure  that  a  clear mistake  has  been  made.  The  chair  umpire  is  responsible  for  calling  any  line (including foot-faults) or net where no line umpire or net umpire is assigned.

A  line  umpire  who  cannot  make  a  call  shall  signal  this  immediately  to  the  chair umpire who shall make a decision. If the line umpire cannot make a call, or if there is no line umpire, and the chair umpire cannot make a decision on a question of fact, the point shall be replayed.

In  team  events  where  the  referee  is  sitting  on-court,  the  referee  is  also  the  final authority on questions of fact.

Play  may  be  stopped  or  suspended  at  any  time  the  chair  umpire  decides  it  is necessary or appropriate.

The referee may also stop or suspend play in the case of darkness, weather or adverse court conditions. When play is suspended for darkness, this should be done at the end of a set, or after an even number of games have been played in the set in progress. After a suspension in play, the score and position of players on-court in the match shall stand when the match resumes.

The  chair  umpire  or  referee  shall  make  decisions  regarding  continuous  play  and coaching in respect of any Code of Conduct that is approved and in operation.

Case 1: The chair umpire awards the server a first service after an overrule, but the receiver  argues  that  it  should  be  a  second  service,  since  the  server  had  already served a fault. Should the referee be called to court to give a decision? Decision: Yes. The chair umpire makes the first decision about questions of tennis law (issues relating to the application of specific facts). However, if a player appeals the  chair  umpire's  decision,  then  the  referee  shall  be  called  to  make  the  final decision.

Case 2: A ball is called out, but a player claims that the ball  was good. May the referee be called to court to make a decision?

Decision: No. The chair umpire makes the final decision on questions of fact (issues relating to what actually happened during a specific incident).

Case 3: Is a chair umpire allowed to overrule a line umpire at the end of a point if, in the chair umpire's opinion, a clear mistake was made earlier in the point? Decision: No. A chair umpire may only overrule a line umpire immediately after the clear mistake has been made.

Case 4: A line umpire calls a ball 'Out' and then the player argues that the ball was good. Is the chair umpire allowed to overrule the line umpire? Decision:  No.  A  chair  umpire  must  never  overrule  as  the  result  of  the  protest  or appeal by a player

Case  5:  A  line  umpire  calls  a  ball  'Out'.  The  chair  umpire  was  unable  to  see clearly, but thought the ball was in. May the chair umpire overrule the line umpire? Decision: No. The chair umpire may only overrule when sure that the line umpire made a clear mistake.

Case  6:  Is  a  line  umpire  allowed  to  change  the  call  after  the  chair  umpire  has announced the score?

Decision: Yes. If a line umpire realises a mistake, a correction should be made as soon as possible provided it is not as the result of a protest or appeal of a player.

Case 7: If a chair umpire or line umpire calls 'Out' and then corrects the call to good, what is the correct decision?

Decision: The chair umpire must decide if the original 'Out' call was a hindrance to  either  player.  If  it  was  a  hindrance,  the  point  shall  be  replayed.  If  it  was  not  a hindrance, the player who hit the ball wins the point.

Case 8: A ball is blown back over the net and the player correctly reaches over the net to try to play the ball. The opponent(s) hinders the player from doing this. What is the correct decision?

Decision:  The  chair  umpire  must  decide  if  the  hindrance  was  deliberate  or unintentional and either awards the point to the hindered player or order the point to be replayed.

## BALL MARK INSPECTION PROCEDURES

- 1. Ball mark inspections can only be made on clay courts.
- 2. A ball mark inspection requested by a player (team) shall be allowed only if the chair umpire cannot determine the call with certainty from their chair on either a point-ending shot or when a player (team) stops playing the point during a rally (returns are permitted but then the player must immediately stop).
- 3. When the chair umpire has decided to make a ball mark inspection, they should go down from the chair and make the inspection themselves. If they do not know where the mark is, they can ask the line umpire for help in locating the mark, but then the chair umpire shall inspect it.
- 4. The  original  call  or  overrule  will  always  stand  if  the  line  umpire  and  chair umpire cannot determine the location of the mark or if the mark is unreadable.
- 5. Once the chair umpire has identified and ruled on a ball mark, this decision is final and not appealable.
- 6. In  clay  court  tennis  the  chair  umpire  should  not  be  too  quick  to  announce  the score  unless  absolutely  certain  of  the  call.  If  in  doubt,  wait  before  calling  the score to determine whether a ball mark inspection is necessary.
- 7. In doubles the appealing player must make their appeal in such a way that either play  stops  or  the  chair  umpire  stops  play.  If  an  appeal  is  made  to  the  chair umpire,  then  they  must  first  determine  that  the  correct  appeal  procedure  was followed.  If  it  was  not  correct  or  if  it  was  late,  then  the  chair  umpire  may determine that the opposing team was deliberately hindered.
- 8. If a player erases the ball mark before the chair umpire has made a final decision, they concede the call.
- 9. A player may not cross the net to check a ball mark without being subject to the Unsportsmanlike provision of the Code of Conduct.

## ELECTRONIC REVIEW PROCEDURES

At tournaments where  an Electronic Review  System  is used, the following procedures should be followed for matches on courts where it is used.

- 1. A request for an Electronic Review of a line call or overrule by a player (team) shall be allowed only on either a point-ending shot or when a player (team) stops playing the point during a rally (returns are permitted but then the player must immediately stop).
- 2. The chair umpire should decide to use the Electronic Review when there is doubt about the accuracy of the line call or overrule. However, the chair umpire may

refuse  the  Electronic  Review  if  they  believe  that  the  player  is  making  an unreasonable request or that it was not made in a timely manner.

- 3. In doubles the appealing player must make their appeal in such a way that either play  stops  or  the  chair  umpire  stops  play.  If  an  appeal  is  made  to  the  chair umpire,  then  they  must  first  determine  that  the  correct  appeal  procedure  was followed.  If  it  was  not  correct  or  if  it  was  late,  then  the  chair  umpire  may determine that the opposing team was deliberately hindered, in which case the appealing team loses the point.
- 4. The original call or overrule will always stand if the Electronic Review is unable, for whatever reason, to make a decision on that line call or overrule.
- 5. The chair umpire's final decision will be the outcome of the Electronic Review and is not appealable. If a manual choice is required for the system to review a particular  ball  impact,  a  review  official  approved  by  the  referee  shall  decide which ball impact is reviewed.
- 6. Each player (team) is allowed three (3) unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one (1) additional  appeal  in  the  tie-break.  For  matches  with  advantage  sets,  players (teams) will start again with a maximum of three (3) unsuccessful appeals at 6 games all and every 12 games thereafter. For matches with match tie-break, the match tie-break counts as a new set and each player (team) starts with three (3) appeals. Players (teams) will have an unlimited number of successful appeals.

## Timed matches:

For 10 and under tennis competition the tournament committee may set a specific time period for matches in the event.

## APPENDIX IX

## PLAN OF THE COURT

Note: All court measurements shall be made to the outside of the lines.


## APPENDIX X

## SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO MARK OUT A COURT Including Blended Lines

Note: All court measurements shall be made to the outside of the lines.


The following procedure is for the usual combined doubles and singles court. (See note at foot for a court for one purpose only.)

First select the position of the net; a straight line 42 feet (12.80 m) long. Mark the centre (X on the diagram above) and, measuring from there in each direction, mark:

at 13'6" (4.11 m) the points a, b, where the net crosses the inner sidelines,

- at 16'6" (5.03 m) the positions of the singles sticks (n, n),
- at 18'0" (5.48 m) the points A, B, where the net crosses the outer sidelines,

at 21'0" (6.40 m) the positions of the net posts (N, N), being the ends of the original 42'0" (12.80 m) line.

Insert pegs at A and B and attach to them the respective ends of two measuring tapes.

On  one,  which  will  measure  the  diagonal  of  the  half-court,  take  a  length  53'1" (16.18 m) and on the other (to measure the sideline) a length of 39'0" (11.89 m). Pull both taut so that at these distances they meet at a point C, which is one corner of the court.  Reverse  the  measurements  to  find  the  other  corner  D.  As  a  check  on  this operation it is advisable at this stage to verify the length of the line CD which, being the baseline, should be found to be 36'0" (10.97 m); and at the same time its centre J can be marked, and also the ends of the inner sidelines (c, d), 4'6" (1.37 m) from C and D.

The centreline and serviceline are now marked by means of the points F, H, G, which are measured 21'0" (6.40 m) from the net down the lines bc, XJ, ad, respectively. Identical procedure the other side of the net completes the court.

If a singles court only is required, no lines are necessary outside the points a, b, c, d, but the court can be measured out as above. Alternatively, the corners of the baseline (c, d) can be found if preferred by pegging the two tapes at a and b instead of at A and B, and by then using lengths of 47'5" (14.46 m) and 39'0" (11.89 m). The net posts will be at n, n, and a 33'0" (10 m) singles net should be used.

When a combined doubles and singles court with a doubles net is used for singles, the net must be supported at the points n, n, to a height of 3 feet 6 inches (1.07 m) by means of two singles sticks, which shall be not more than 3 inches (7.5 cm) square or 3 inches  (7.5 cm)  in  diameter.  The  centres  of  the  singles  sticks  shall  be  3 feet (.914 m) outside the singles court on each side.

To  assist  in  the  placing  of  these  singles  sticks  it  is  desirable  that  the  points  n,  n, should each be shown with a white dot when the court is marked.

When sanctioning bodies approve so called 'Blended Lines' on courts the following guidelines must be followed:

## Colour:

- · Within the same colour family as the background playing surface.
- · Lighter than the background playing surface.
- · Limit on colour variation of +22 points on the L* scale

(Add ≤25% by volume of white paint to the background colour)

## Pace:

- · Within 5 CPR of the playing surface.

## Dimensions:

- · 1.0-1.5 cm narrower than the standard lines.

## Marking:

- · Terminate 8 cm from intersection with white playing lines.

Note: As a guide for international competitions, the recommended minimum distance between the baselines and the backstops should be 21 feet (6.40 m) and between the sidelines  and  the  sidestops  the  recommended  minimum  distance  should  be  12 feet (3.66 m).

As  a  guide  for  recreational  and  Club  play,  the  recommended  minimum  distance between the baselines and the backstops should be 18 feet (5.48 m) and between the sidelines  and  the  sidestops  the  recommended  minimum  distance  should  be  10 feet (3.05 m).

As a guide, the recommended minimum height measured at the net from the court surface to the ceiling should be 29.6 feet (9.0 m).
