  - context: |-
      a. During a standard game or a tie-break game, if a player serves from the wrong half of the court, this should be corrected as soon as the error is discovered, and the server shall serve from the correct half of the court according to the score. A fault that was served before the error was discovered shall stand.
      b. During a standard game or a tie-break game, if the players are at the wrong ends of  the  court,  the  error  should  be  corrected  as  soon  as  it  is  discovered,  and  the server shall serve from the correct end of the court according to the score.
      c. If  a  player  serves  out  of  turn  during  a  standard  game,  the  player  who  was originally due to serve shall serve as soon as the error is discovered. However, if
      a  game  is  completed  before  the  error  is  discovered  the  order  of  service  shall remain  as  altered.  In  this  case,  any  ball  change  to  be  made  after  an  agreed number of games should be made one game later than originally scheduled.
      A fault that was served by the opponents(s) before the error was discovered shall not stand.
      In doubles, if the partners of one team serve out of turn, a fault that was served before the error was discovered shall stand.
      d. If a player serves out of turn during a tie-break game and the error is discovered after an  even  number  of  points  have  been  played,  the  error  is  corrected immediately. If the error is discovered after an odd number of points have been played, the order of service shall remain as altered.
      A fault that was served by the opponent(s) before the error was discovered shall not stand.
      In doubles, if the partners of one team serve out of turn, a fault that was served before the error was discovered shall stand.
      e. During a standard game or a tie-break game in doubles, if there is an error in the order of receiving, this shall remain as altered until the end of the game in which the error is discovered. For the next game in which they are the receivers in that set, the partners shall then resume the original order of receiving.
      f. If  in  error  a  tie-break  game  is  started  at  6  games  all,  when  it  was  previously agreed  that  the  set  would  be  an  'Advantage  set',  the  error  shall  be  corrected immediately if only one point has been played. If the error is discovered after the second point is in play, the set will continue as a 'Tie-break set'.
      g. If  in  error  a  standard  game  is  started  at  6  games  all,  when  it  was  previously agreed  that  the  set  would  be  a  'Tie-break  set',  the  error  shall  be  corrected immediately if only one point has been played. If the error is discovered after the second  point  is  in  play,  the  set  will  continue  as  an  'Advantage  set'  until  the score reaches 8 games all (or a higher even number), when a tie-break game shall be played.
      h. If in  error  an  'Advantage  set'  or  'Tie-break  set'  is  started,  when  it  was previously agreed that the final set would be a match tie-break, the error shall be corrected  immediately  if  only  one  point  has  been  played.  If  the  error  is discovered after the second point is in play, the set will continue either until a player or team wins three games (and therefore the set) or until the score reaches 2  games  all,  when  a  match  tie-break  shall  be  played.  However,  if  the  error  is discovered  after  the  second  point  of  the  fifth  game  has  started,  the  set  will continue as a 'Tie-break set'. (See Appendix VI)
      i. If the balls are not changed in the correct sequence, the error shall be corrected when the player/team who should have served with new balls is next due to serve a new game. Thereafter the balls shall be changed so that the number of games between ball changes shall be that originally agreed. Balls should not be changed during a game.

          What are the rules regarding serving out of turn during a standard game or a
          tie-break game?
        answer: |-
          If a player serves out of turn during a standard game, the player who was
          originally due to serve shall serve as soon as the error is discovered. However,
          if a game is completed before the error is discovered, the order of service
          shall remain as altered. In doubles, if the partners of one team serve out of

          If the balls are not changed in the correct sequence, what are the consequences
          and when is the error corrected?
        answer: |-
          The error is corrected when the player/team who should have served with new
          balls is next due to serve a new game. Thereafter, the balls are changed so that
          the number of games between ball changes is that originally agreed. Balls should
          not be changed during a game.
  - context: |-
      a. Between points, a maximum of twenty-five (25) seconds is allowed. When the players change ends at the end of a game, a maximum of ninety (90) seconds are allowed. However, after the first game of each set and during a tie-break game, play shall be continuous and the players shall change ends without a rest.
      At the end of each set there shall be a set break of a maximum of one hundred and twenty (120) seconds.
      The maximum time starts from the moment that one point finishes until the first service is struck for the next point.
      Event organisers may apply for ITF approval to extend the ninety (90) seconds allowed when the players change ends at the end of a game and the one hundred and twenty (120) seconds allowed at a set break.
      b. If,  for  reasons  outside  the  player's  control,  clothing,  footwear  or  necessary equipment (excluding the racket) is broken or needs to be replaced, the player may be allowed reasonable extra time to rectify the problem.
      c. No extra time shall be given to allow a player to recover condition. However, a player suffering from a treatable medical condition may be allowed one medical time-out of three minutes for the treatment of that medical condition. A limited number of toilet/change of attire breaks may also be allowed, if this is announced in advance of the event.
      d. Event organisers may allow a rest period of a maximum of ten (10) minutes if this is announced in advance of the event. This rest period can be taken after the 3rd set in a best of 5 sets match, or after the 2nd set in a best of 3 sets match.

      2. A ball mark inspection requested by a player (team) shall be allowed only if the chair umpire cannot determine the call with certainty from their chair on either a point-ending shot or when a player (team) stops playing the point during a rally (returns are permitted but then the player must immediately stop).
      3. When the chair umpire has decided to make a ball mark inspection, they should go down from the chair and make the inspection themselves. If they do not know where the mark is, they can ask the line umpire for help in locating the mark, but then the chair umpire shall inspect it.
      4. The  original  call  or  overrule  will  always  stand  if  the  line  umpire  and  chair umpire cannot determine the location of the mark or if the mark is unreadable.
      5. Once the chair umpire has identified and ruled on a ball mark, this decision is final and not appealable.
      6. In  clay  court  tennis  the  chair  umpire  should  not  be  too  quick  to  announce  the score  unless  absolutely  certain  of  the  call.  If  in  doubt,  wait  before  calling  the score to determine whether a ball mark inspection is necessary.
      7. In doubles the appealing player must make their appeal in such a way that either play  stops  or  the  chair  umpire  stops  play.

      4. The original call or overrule will always stand if the Electronic Review is unable, for whatever reason, to make a decision on that line call or overrule.
      5. The chair umpire's final decision will be the outcome of the Electronic Review and is not appealable. If a manual choice is required for the system to review a particular  ball  impact,  a  review  official  approved  by  the  referee  shall  decide which ball impact is reviewed.
      6. Each player (team) is allowed three (3) unsuccessful appeals per set, plus one (1) additional  appeal  in  the  tie-break.  For  matches  with  advantage  sets,  players (teams) will start again with a maximum of three (3) unsuccessful appeals at 6 games all and every 12 games thereafter.
